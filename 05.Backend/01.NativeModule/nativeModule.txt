//What are native module in JavaScript 
// Native module can be understand as pre built library packed into javaScript local runtime
//enviorment that it can be treated as the pre install game which comes with the windows 
//operating system like pinball or minesweeper

//so node module are the code written by someone else but we can use it in our code it can also
//be treated like a pre built function and they are the starting tool set to make server
//side application and the code that was written into native node module are File access
//ie reading and writing into local file system or the server computer another pre written 
//module are networking module which is important for the backend of our application and there 
//are lot more which can be found in Nodejs Documentation and we will use some module 
//to built our app

//With native javascript which run in the web browser we cant access the user file system cause 
//that will be treated as mallicious code and is wrong practise as it harms the privacy of user

//but in case of nodejs cause it brings out the javascript out of the browser we can access//
//the file system locally
