Centering Element with CSS :
--------------------------------

Now lets use some of the knowledge about positioning in order to make our website the way we 
want .


->lets take a website example of the css module series.

Now the first thing we want to achieve is we want to center all the Element on the page ie 
image , heading and paragraph

There are couple of ways to do that but easiest way is to use a CSS property
text-align 

Note the text-align property should be always set in the parent tag ie since we want to 
center the image , heading and paragraph element we have to put the text-align property
inside the parent tag(<body>)

lets see with code:

<body>
    <img src="cloud.png">
    <h1>Hey I'am Shivansh</h1>
    <p>i am a <span>pro</span>grammmer</p>
    <img src="cloud.png">
    <img src="hill.png">
</body>

Now since we have to align thses tag in center we need to put the text-align property
in body tag which is the parent tag for this element .

CSS--

body
{
    margin:0;
    text-align:center;
} 

Note :But the problem with text-align is that it only works with inline and block element .

and as soon as we apply any css on these  two type of element ie inline or block like 
width,height or display property (text-align) wont work.

let's see with example :

<body>
    <img src="cloud.png">
    <h1>Hey I'am Shivansh</h1>
    <p>i am a <span>pro</span>grammmer</p>
    <img src="cloud.png">
    <img src="hill.png">
</body>

css 
---

body
{
    margin:0px;
    text-align:center;
}

h1
{
    width : 10 %;}//10% of screen

so as we can see as sookn as we changed our <h1> width it's text-align ment property
also changed and it is not aligned in center anymore.


So how can we resolve this well the other way to align the element in center is :
->To set the element margin.


Synatx of css margin:

margin:top right bottom left;

Now to center the element or a tag we use one of the margin value ie auto

so if we want to align a element to center with no margin on top and bottom we cann do 
it easily with help of auto

{
    margin:0px auto 0px auto;
}

auto - auto value is a unique property or value under margin which we can use to set 
the margin property of element so that it can vertically and horizontally take as much 
amount of margin it can given there is a sufficient amount of space

So to center the element we will use this Synatx:

margin:0px auto 0px auto;

but instead of writing it like this again and again we can shorten it very easily.

using :{margin:0px auto ;}

where the first value is for top and bottom and the second value is for left and right


But for now we will just use the text-align property of the element to center 

So lets remove our change in <h1> element ie the width and margin css and lets go back
to default value and just change the text-align property to center .


html
---------
<body>
    <img src="cloud.png">
    <h1>Hey I'am Shivansh</h1>
    <p>i am a <span>pro</span>grammmer</p>
    <img src="cloud.png">
    <img src="hill.png">
</body>

css 
---

body
{
    margin:0px;
    text-align:center;
}

Now the problem here is that the two <img> tag containing cloud and hill are inline tag
and that's why our hill <img> is not aligining in middle cause of the cloud image 
as cloud image is before it and its taking its space , now we need to align the hill image 
in center with our text and since cloud image is in the flow of html file its pushing hill image 
to side so we need to take the cloud out if the flow and we can do that by changing the 
cloud image position property and as soon we change the position property of cloud 
image the text-align property will no longer work and cause of position property 
it wont go back to original place instead it will get place random somewhere before hill


html
---------
<body>
    <img src="cloud.png">
    <h1>Hey I'am Shivansh</h1>
    <p>i am a <span>pro</span>grammmer</p>
    <img src="cloud.png" class="bottom-cloud">
    <img src="hill.png">
</body>

css

body
{
    margin:0px;
    text-align:center;
}

.bottom-cloud
{
    position:absolute;
}
