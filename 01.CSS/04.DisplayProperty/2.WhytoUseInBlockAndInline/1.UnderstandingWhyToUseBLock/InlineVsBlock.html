    <title>Inline Vs Block</title>
</head>
<body>
    <!--
    So from last directory material we understood that block element take more space compare to a inline 
element

So why to use block tag/block element when they take so much line and space and why not just use 
inline tag:

The Problem with inline tag is that we cant change it's height and width property
lets take a example to learn :

Ex:
----

<body>
    <p>Hello</p>
    <p>World</p>
    <span>Hello</span>
    <span>World</span>
</body>

-->
    <p>Hello</p>
    <p>World</p>
    <span>Hello</span>
    <span>World</span>
    <!--
        lets give this a background color :

css 
---
p{background-color:red;}
span{background-color:blue;}


We gave this color to identify the  changes in the element 

So as we can see the area in which background-color blue is genrated is the required 
area coverd by the word and that is why the span is inline tag

Where as the red background color has taken up the whole line because the css is 
applied to <p> tag which is a block tag
