So from last directory material we understood that block element take more space compare to a inline 
element

So why to use block tag/block element when they take so much line and space and why not just use 
inline tag:

The Problem with inline tag is that we cant change it's height and width property
lets take a example to learn :

Ex:
----

<body>
    <p>Hello</p>
    <p>World</p>
    <span>Hello</span>
    <span>World</span>
</body>


lets give this a background color :

css 
---
p{background-color:red;}
span{background-color:blue;}


We gave this color to identify the  changes in the element 

So as we can see the area in which background-color blue is genrated is the required 
area coverd by the word and that is why the span is inline tag

Where as the red background color has taken up the whole line because the css is 
applied to <p> tag which is a block tag


Now lets change the height and width of the the both span and p tag

<body>
    <p>Hello</p>
    <p>World</p>
    <span>Hello</span>
    <span>World</span>
</body>


css 
---
p{background-color:red;width:200px;}
span{background-color:blue;width:200px;}


So now as we can see <p> tag width has been reduced but still blocks the line 
where as <span> tag width is still same and it dosent change 

Now , the Problem with block tag is although it can change its width it dosent
let any other element sit / get displayed on that line 

and in order to overcome this problem we have css property display and via this we can
change inline to block and block to inline

But although we can change block to inline ,but as soon as we change block to inline
we loose the block tag property to change width and height

Similarly if we change inline tag to block then we can change it width and height.


<body>
    <p>Hello</p>
    <p>World</p>
    <span>Hello</span>
    <span>World</span>
</body>


css 
---
p{background-color:red;width:200px;display:inline;}
span{background-color:blue;width:200px;display:block;}

So we can see <p> tag element are in same line and as we have changed their display 
property and now we cannot change their property like width and height and same goes
for span tag which is now in block display and it can change its width and height.


So now what do to so that we can get the inline tag ability to take the amount of 
space required byt word but also use block tag property like changing width and height

well for that we use display:inline-block;
