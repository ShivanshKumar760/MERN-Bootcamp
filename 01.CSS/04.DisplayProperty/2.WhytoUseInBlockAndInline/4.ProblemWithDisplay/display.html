   But although we can change block to inline ,but as soon as we change block to inline
we loose the block tag property to change width and height

Similarly if we change inline tag to block then we can change it width and height.


<body>
    <p>Hello</p>
    <p>World</p>
    <span>Hello</span>
    <span>World</span>
</body>


css 
---
p{background-color:red;width:200px;display:inline;}
span{background-color:blue;width:200px;display:block;}

So we can see <p> tag element are in same line and as we have changed their display 
property and now we cannot change their property like width and height and same goes
for span tag which is now in block display and it can change its width and height.
