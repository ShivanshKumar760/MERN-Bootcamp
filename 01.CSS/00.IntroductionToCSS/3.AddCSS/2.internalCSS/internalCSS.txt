Internal CSS
--------------
The internal css/style sheet is used to add a unique style for a single document.It is defined in <head>
section of the html page inside <style> tag

<html>
    <head>
        <style>
            h1,h2,#para{text-align:center;color:blue;}
        </style>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Welcome</h1>
        <p>This style will appear on every paragraph</p>
        <p id = "para">me too </p>
        <p class="center">This paragraph should be in center with blue color </p>
        <h2 class="center">This is a heading and it  should be in center with blue color </h2>

    </body>
</html>

Disadvantage of internal css is we can style only a single document ie web page at a time and for 
multi page website we have to write css code again.
