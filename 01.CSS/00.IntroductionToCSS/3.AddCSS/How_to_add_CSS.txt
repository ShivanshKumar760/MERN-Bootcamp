CSS is added to html page to format the document according to the information in the style sheet . There 
are three three ways to insert CSS in html document

1)inline CSS
2)internal CSS
2)external CSS


Inline CSS
--------
->We can apply css in a single element by inline css technique.
->The inline CSS is also method to insert style sheet in html document

->the method mitigates some advantage of style sheet in html document so it is advised to use this method 
sparingly

->if we want to use the inline CSS we should use inline css , we should use the style attribute to the 
relevant tag 

Syntax:
---------------

<html_tag style="css-property1:value;....css-propertyn:value;">content</html_tag>

Example:
<h2 style ="color : red; margin-left:40px;">Heading number 2</h2>

<p>This paragraph tag is not affected</p>

Disadvantage of inline css
------------------------
1)We cannot use the quotation within the inline css.If we use quotation the browser will interpret this as 
an end of our style value 

2)These style cannot be reused anywhere else 

3)These style are tough to be edited because they are not stored at a single place.

4)It is not possible to style pseudo-code and pseudo-classes in the with the inline css

5)Inline Css does not provide browser cache advantage.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
II)Internal CSS
--------------
The internal css/style sheet is used to add a unique style for a single document.It is defined in <head>
section of the html page inside <style> tag

<html>
    <head>
        <style>
            h1,h2,#para{text-align:center;color:blue;}
        </style>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Welcome</h1>
        <p>This style will appear on every paragraph</p>
        <p id = "para">me too </p>
        <p class="center">This paragraph should be in center with blue color </p>
        <h2 class="center">This is a heading and it  should be in center with blue color </h2>

    </body>
</html>

Disadvantage of internal css is we can style only a single document ie web page at a time and for 
multi page website we have to write css code again.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

III)External CSS
-----------------

The external css is generally used when we want to make changes to multiple pages.It is ideal for this 
condition because it facilates you / us to change the look of the entire website by changing just one
file 

it uses the <link> tag on every page to link the the style sheet to html document and link tag
should be put inside the head section.

Ex:
<head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="urlof_stylesheet.css"> 
</head>
