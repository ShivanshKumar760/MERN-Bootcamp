External CSS
-----------------

The external css is generally used when we want to make changes to multiple pages.It is ideal for this 
condition because it facilates you / us to change the look of the entire website by changing just one
file 

it uses the <link> tag on every page to link the the style sheet to html document and link tag
should be put inside the head section.

Ex:
<head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="urlof_stylesheet.css"> 
</head>
