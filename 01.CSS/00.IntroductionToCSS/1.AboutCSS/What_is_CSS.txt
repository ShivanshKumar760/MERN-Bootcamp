When Does Need for CSS genrated in web development .
------------------------------------------------------
In very beginning when internet was new to people there was no css only html was present,but
when of the things that developer wanted to do was style there website and make them the way they
wanted to look website , but they were really really limited by html and Marc Andresson sent 
a mail who was founder of MOSAIC the most earliest browser in the history of web and he later 
found the netscape and recently Andreessen Horowitz vc fund

And this mail he answered the developer about styling the website

He stated that controlling document ie the website code is not possible the way it is in Microsoft
word and TeX "Sorry,you're screwed"

To which the W3Consortium responded by realeasig a new version of html
ie HTML 3.2 which cmaeout in 1997 , it introduced new html tags like (<font> which allowed you 
to describe font size , color and face of content),<center> which allowed you to format you document

But these tags are depricated that mens they no longer are used to style the document the way
they were used back then cause the main motoof HTML was to structure the documen and not to style
it cause using tags like font ,color ,background-color ie background style,element alignment 
,border and size had to be repeated by the user on every web page.This was a very long process
.For example  if we are developing a large web site where fonts and color information are added 
onto every single page ,it will become very difficult to use these tage and maintain code redeablity
It is  a very long and expensive process.

Well to overcome this in 1996 W3Consortium led by HaKon Wium lie and they introduced CSS
this allowed to attach style ie fonts and color to html document.
