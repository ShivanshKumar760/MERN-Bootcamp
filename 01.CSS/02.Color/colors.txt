Till Now in our previous module we saw how to use color in html in two ways :

1)setting the background-color for a element or tag
Ex:
<body style="background-color:red;">//will put red in whole HTML page 
2)setting color for text 
<h1 style = "color:white;">Hello</h1> //will color the text Hello red 

And if we look closely in both background-color and color we have used named color scheme that is 
in both the background-color and the color under value of color we have used named color like 
"red" and "white"

But we can also use hexcode and rgb(x,y,b) value to set the color  or background-color of element

Ex:
rgb
-----
h1
{
    color:rgb(63,75,145);
}

or 

hexcode
--------
body
{
    background-color:#808080 //whose rgb value is :	128,128,128
}

So basically in css colors are specified using predefined color names, or 
RGB, HEX, HSL, RGBA, HSLA values.
